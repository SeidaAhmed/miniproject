# miniproject

This project is a Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors Tournament built using Object-Oriented Programming. It features human and computer players competing in a single-elimination format with best-of-three matches. The system uses modular classes for players, matches, and tournaments, allowing both interactive play and automated simulations. It demonstrates core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.
